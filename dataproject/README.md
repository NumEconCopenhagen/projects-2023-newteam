# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Wellbeing and GDP** and is about how a country's GDP correlates with the wellbeing of its citizens measured with death from suicide, alcohol and drugs.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. HSL.csv (*OECD.org*) 
1. NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD (*https://data.worldbank.org/*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
