# Inaugural project

Group members: Qi , Yasmin, Tore

The aim of this project is to examine how heterosexual couples allocate their time between market work and home production to maximize their overall utility. Specifically, the project investigates the impact of various factors such as relative productivity in home production, elasticity of substitution, and the relative wage of partners on the amount of time spent on domestic work.

The **notebook** leans on code provided in inauguralproject.py.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
